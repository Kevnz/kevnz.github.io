A Farewell to Jack
==================

The news we were expecting and dreading finally came. My wifes
Grandfather passed away. Now I’ve always had a soft spot in my heart for
Granddad. He reminded me of my Granddaddy back in the states, hard
working, no nonsense sort of fellow. He always liked telling me about
serving in “The War” with the Yanks.

I know my wife was continuously amazed that I never got a Granddad
lecture when I borrowed his trailer or anything else. Everybody, I mean
EVERYBODY get’s a Granddad lecture, “Fold the cover this way, tie the
ropes that way….” Not me. I always told my wife that he trusted me, of
course it could be cause he had a hard time understanding a word I said.

His final months weren’t easy for any of us. To see a man that always
stayed busy, be it in his garden, or making baby chairs for his growing
number of great grandchildren, or his special “Granddad Boxes”
(cardboard boxes with sturdy handles and a lined bottom, quite handy
actually) or playing golf, struggle to get out of a chair is heart
wrenching.

Now comes the hard part. I dread telling my girls that Granddad has
passed away. However, I do feel blessed that they got to have him around
as long as they did, I mean he was 87 after all. Plus the family and the
funeral…I hate funerals. But I hate saying goodbye more.

I’ll miss ya Granddad…
