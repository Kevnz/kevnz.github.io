A Weekend With Windows 8
========================

I attended a Windows 8 “Hackathon” this past weekend and would like
share some thoughts on Windows 8, and in my next post some thoughts
about developing for Windows 8. 

Now there has been a lot of negative reactions from people about Windows
8 because basically Microsoft moved peoples cheese. There is no start
button, there are two environments and there is no close button for
metro apps. So when things change people complain. How many times did I
miss the start button over the weekend? Not once. Not a single time did
I think to myself I really need that start button here. Why? Windows 8
makes it easy find apps. It’s actually easier to find apps in Windows 8
then it is to use the start menu. So for the people complaining about no
start menu, get over it.

Metro versus the desktop. A lot has been written about switching between
Metro and the desktop, and there are some legitimate concerns. While not
jarring, or even distracting, every time I switched between a desktop
app and a metro app I was reminded why Microsoft is moving to metro
apps, an app isn’t about chrome, it’s about the app. An App should stand
on it’s merit, and the os should get the hell out of it’s way. Metro
makes that happen. Hopefully this will motivate existing app makers to
get on to making metro versions of their apps.

How do I close an app? Grab it and dump it. Was easy when you see it
done. There are lots of things like that in Windows 8. Once you know how
to do something that becomes crazy simple to do. Microsoft will have to
work at. Of course a few quick intro slides on setup would get it into
peoples heads. It is that easy, but it’s only easy if you know about it.
 

There were lots of little things about Windows 8 that I like, things
like the file explorer (that had a lot of nerd rage about the ribbon)
that while had the ribbon, it got out of the way and actually gave me
more room than in previous versions. Another thing is Live tiles in
Metro. I love live tiles and Metro allows apps to establish an ongoing
relationship with users without even opening an app. 

It is a preview release, so nothing is perfect. But for a preview it was
pretty solid and the only real issue I had was a mac bootcamp driver
crashing. Here’s hoping that Microsoft can really nail this release.
Hopefully  I’ll have up a developing for Windows 8 post in the next day
or so.
