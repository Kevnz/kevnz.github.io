                        <p>I&#8217;ve been busy lately building Single Page Apps using the YUI App Framework and one thing I found is that when an app hits a certain size the actual Application container gets messy pretty quick. You spend all this time separating out the pieces of your app into views and models, but then the &#8220;glue&#8221; of the routes and event handling you end up with a massive &#8220;mess&#8221; of code. Even well structured code becomes difficult to maintain when it starts to creep up past a few hundred lines of well formatted code. So what can you do?</p>
<p>My first pass was just trying to mix in multiple apps.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevnz/6521348.js" type="text/javascript"></script><p>This did not work. I realized that since each module has a views property they are getting overwritten, not merged, and the same was happening with the routes attribute as well. So that&#8217;s no good. So I considered extending App with something like .addSubApp() but that had it&#8217;s own problems.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s a dev todo? I really wanted the create syntax because that expressed what I wanted. Plus, I love mixing in modules, it allows for a lot of creation with little code. So I had a browse of what the YUI team are <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/files/base_js_BaseBuild.js.html#l329" target="_blank">doing</a>Â and decided that I would have to do something with that.</p>
<p>What I did</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevnz/6521528.js" type="text/javascript"></script><p>I took the core of the build method in base-built and added specific checks for views and routes and merged them together. This <a href="https://github.com/Kevnz/yui-app-extensions/blob/master/src/apps/js/app-create.js" target="_blank">module</a> is at my YUI App Extensions <a href="https://github.com/Kevnz/yui-app-extensions" target="_blank">repository</a> on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">github</a> and I am happy to take comments or pull requests. I also have several other modules at that repo that are useful for App Development as well.</p>
