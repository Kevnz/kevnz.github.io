                        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been busy lately building Single Page Apps using the YUI App Framework and one thing I found is that when an app hits a certain size the actual Application container gets messy pretty quick. You spend all this time separating out the pieces of your app into views and models, but then the &amp;#8220;glue&amp;#8221; of the routes and event handling you end up with a massive &amp;#8220;mess&amp;#8221; of code. Even well structured code becomes difficult to maintain when it starts to creep up past a few hundred lines of well formatted code. So what can you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first pass was just trying to mix in multiple apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/Kevnz/6521348.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;This did not work. I realized that since each module has a views property they are getting overwritten, not merged, and the same was happening with the routes attribute as well. So that&amp;#8217;s no good. So I considered extending App with something like .addSubApp() but that had it&amp;#8217;s own problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s a dev todo? I really wanted the create syntax because that expressed what I wanted. Plus, I love mixing in modules, it allows for a lot of creation with little code. So I had a browse of what the YUI team are &lt;a href=&quot;http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/files/base_js_BaseBuild.js.html#l329&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;doing&lt;/a&gt;Â and decided that I would have to do something with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I did&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/Kevnz/6521528.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took the core of the build method in base-built and added specific checks for views and routes and merged them together. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Kevnz/yui-app-extensions/blob/master/src/apps/js/app-create.js&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;module&lt;/a&gt; is at my YUI App Extensions &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Kevnz/yui-app-extensions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; and I am happy to take comments or pull requests. I also have several other modules at that repo that are useful for App Development as well.&lt;/p&gt;
